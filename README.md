semver-sml
==========

A Semantic Versioning library for Standard ML, currently based on
[SemVer 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). 

This implementation aims to be a strict and straightforward
implementation of the standard (so no messing around with
maybe-allowing the leading 'v'). The files [semver.tests] and
[[semver-big.tests]] aim to capture some general-purpose test cases.
